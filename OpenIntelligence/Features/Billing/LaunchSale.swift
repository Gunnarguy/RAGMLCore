//  LaunchSale.swift
//  OpenIntelligence
//
//  Whether a launch discount is being advertised right now, and what the price was before it.
//
//  WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//
//  StoreKit reports only what a product costs at this moment. There is no API for a previous
//  price, and the App Store draws no strikethrough, no "was/now" and no sale badge for in-app
//  purchases. A scheduled temporary price change is therefore invisible to the customer: they
//  see a smaller number with no way to know it is a discount or that it ends. The app has to
//  say so itself, which means the app has to hold the regular price.
//
//  WHAT GUARDS THE CLAIM
//
//  A hardcoded "was" price is a factual claim about money, so two conditions must both hold:
//
//    1. `now` is inside `window`.
//    2. StoreKit's reported price is strictly below the regular price recorded here, compared
//       within the same currency.
//
//  Condition 2 does the work. If the temporary price change was never scheduled or has already
//  reverted, the price is not lower and nothing is claimed whatever the calendar says.
//
//  THE LIMIT OF THAT GUARANTEE, STATED PLAINLY
//
//  Condition 2 is not "a sale is running". It is "the price is below a constant compiled into
//  this build". Apple recalculates its generated per-territory prices when tax rates and
//  exchange rates move, so a regular price recorded today can be higher than the real one in
//  six months, and the app would then advertise a discount nobody scheduled. The table is
//  therefore dated, and `scripts/verify_sale_prices.py` re-reads it from App Store Connect and
//  reports any drift. Run it before every sale. This is a real limitation, not a theoretical one.
//
//  Two further limits worth knowing:
//    - `EntitlementStore` caches its `Product` list, so a price change cancelled mid-session is
//      not seen until the products are refreshed. `PlanUpgradeSheet` refreshes on appear.
//    - The percentage is computed per storefront from the two real numbers and rounded down,
//      because Apple rounds each territory to its own price point. A German customer may
//      genuinely see 28% where a US customer sees 33%, and each is told their own number.
//
//  WHY LIFETIME ONLY
//
//  Pro Annual is deliberately absent. Its 7-day free trial is already its one introductory
//  offer, and a customer may redeem only one per subscription group, so a discount offer would
//  displace the trial. A temporary price change on a subscription is worse still: the revert is
//  a price increase for everyone who subscribed at the sale price, which Apple surfaces through
//  consent prompts and, where consent is required and not given, ends the subscription. Lifetime
//  is a non-consumable, so it reverts with no consequence for anyone who already bought.
