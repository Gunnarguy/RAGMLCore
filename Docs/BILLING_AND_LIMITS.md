# Docs/BILLING_AND_LIMITS.md — verified at v4.4, shipped tree is v5.0

> **Documentation status:** Verified for OpenIntelligence v4.4 on 2026-06-30. Product identifiers and the Document Pack status re-checked against source on 2026-08-05; the quota and grandfathering sections were **not** re-verified.
> **Document Pack Add-On is no longer sold (see §3).** `doc_pack_addon` is absent from `OpenIntelligence/Resources/StoreKit/StoreKitConfiguration.storekit` and has no paywall UI. The `BillingProduct.documentPackAddOn` case, the cap logic, and the `legacyDocumentPackOwner` protection state are deliberately retained so existing owners keep their capacity. `StoreKitBillingService` still requests the id via `BillingProduct.allCases`, and StoreKit simply omits an unavailable product from the result, so nothing fails. `[evidence_level: code_verified, confidence: exact, evidence_source: StoreKitConfiguration.storekit, BillingProduct.swift, PlanUpgradeSheet.swift, StoreKitBillingService.swift:42]`
> **Source of truth:** Codebase audit in `Docs/AUDIT/`.

This document describes the billing tiers, StoreKit 2 product identifiers, and resource quota boundaries as audited in the OpenIntelligence v4.4 codebase.

---

## 1. Product Identifier Register

These StoreKit product IDs are defined centrally in [BillingProduct.swift](../OpenIntelligence/Services/Billing/BillingProduct.swift):

| Product Identifier | rawValue | Kind | Associated Tier | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pro Monthly | `"pro_monthly"` | Subscription | Pro | Grants monthly access to Pro features. |
| Pro Annual | `"pro_annual"` | Subscription | Pro | Grants annual access to Pro features. |
| Lifetime Cohort | `"lifetime_cohort"` | Non-Consumable | Lifetime | One-time purchase for permanent Lifetime access. |
| Document Pack Add-On | `"doc_pack_addon"` | Consumable | None | **Discontinued — not sold.** Granted 10 extra document slots per pack. Enum case and entitlement logic retained for existing owners only. |

---

## 2. Resource Quotas & Limits

Enforcement logic is defined in [QuotaPolicy.swift](../OpenIntelligence/Services/Infrastructure/Configuration/QuotaPolicy.swift) and checked in [EntitlementStore.swift](../OpenIntelligence/Services/Billing/EntitlementStore.swift) at runtime before document ingestion or library creation.

### Quota Matrix by Tier

| Feature / Resource | Free Tier | Pro Tier | Lifetime Tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Document Limit** | 5 documents | 1,000 documents | Unlimited |
| **Library Limit** | 1 library | 10 libraries | 20 libraries |
| **Maximum Mode Runs** | 3 per day (Metered) | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Standard Mode Runs** | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Deep Think Runs** | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |

## 3. Document Pack Add-On Mechanics (discontinued product, retained for existing owners)

> The pack was withdrawn from sale in v4.4. Nothing below describes a purchase a new user can make; it describes how the app continues to honour packs bought before the withdrawal. Read every "purchase" below as "a historical purchase being re-validated."

- **Allowance:** A `"doc_pack_addon"` transaction appends a ledger entry containing 10 credits to `documentPacks`.
- **Enforcement Cap:** Users are capped at a maximum of **3 active document packs** simultaneously (yielding a maximum bonus of +30 documents). The property `hasReachedDocumentPackCap` in [EntitlementStore.swift](../OpenIntelligence/Services/Billing/EntitlementStore.swift#L48) gates purchases if `addOnPacks >= 3`.
- **Expiration:** Consumable packs are verified against transaction expiration dates. Expired packs are pruned on app launch via `pruneExpiredDocumentPacksIfNeeded()`.

---

## 4. Entitlement Reconciliation & Legacy Protection
- **Grandfathering Protection:** A sticky paid-history protection state (`LegacyProtectionState`) is implemented. If a user has a historical paid transaction (subscription or non-consumable), [EntitlementStore.swift](../OpenIntelligence/Services/Billing/EntitlementStore.swift#L356) promotes their state to `.historicalPaidPurchase` or `.legacyDocumentPackOwner` on launch. This maintains their Lifetime access and protects their active document limits even if their StoreKit subscription has expired or is unrenewed.
- **Local Simulation:** In `DEBUG` simulator builds, the app supports simulated billing overrides using `simulateDebugPurchase(_:)` to bypass StoreKit connection failures.

## 5. Promotional pricing and the launch sale

*Added 2026-09-09.*

### Regular prices, as App Store Connect holds them

Only the USA price is set by hand. Apple generates the other 174 storefronts from it, and those
generated figures are what customers actually pay, so they are read from the API rather than
converted.

| Currency | Lifetime Cohort | Pro Annual |
|---|---|---|
| USD | 59.99 | 29.99 |
| GBP | 59.99 | 29.99 |
| EUR | 69.99 | 34.99 |
| CAD | 79.99 | 39.99 |
| AUD | 99.99 | 49.99 |
| INR | 5900 | 2999 |
| JPY | 10000 | 5000 |
| BRL | 399.90 | 199.90 |
| MXN | 1299 | 599 |

Across all 177 generated Lifetime territory prices, every currency resolves to exactly one
amount, which is what makes `LaunchSale` safe to key by currency rather than territory. That is
a property of this price schedule and not a guarantee from Apple, so
`scripts/verify_sale_prices.py` re-checks it and reports drift.
`[evidence_level: measured, confidence: exact, evidence_source: /v1/inAppPurchasePriceSchedules/6756638872/automaticPrices (177 rows) and /v1/subscriptions/6756638919/prices (175 rows), grouped by currency, read 2026-09-09]`

US proceeds are a flat 85% of list under the Small Business Program, which the price point
records show directly. The **blended** net across all territories is lower, 66.4%, because
several storefronts quote VAT-inclusive prices that Apple remits. Use 66.4% for revenue
forecasts and 85% only for US-only questions.
`[evidence_level: measured, confidence: exact, evidence_source: proceeds field on USA price points (85%); SUM(proceeds_usd)/SUM(sales_usd) over the ten Lifetime rows in store_purchases, ~/ASC/data/asc.sqlite3, 2026-09-09. That archive is not version-controlled, so the figure is reproducible only while it exists.]`

### How a discount is delivered, and why the app has to announce it

A non-consumable cannot have a "sale" in the App Store sense. The only mechanism is a
**temporary price change**, which App Store Connect accepts with a start and an end date and
reverts on its own; the maximum length is one year.
`[evidence_level: documented, confidence: exact, evidence_source: https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-in-app-purchases/schedule-price-changes-for-in-app-purchases, fetched 2026-09-09]`

**The App Store shows no strikethrough, no "was/now" and no sale badge for in-app purchases.** A
customer during a price change simply sees a smaller number. The discount therefore does not
exist as a discount unless the app says so, which is what `LaunchSale` and the paywall banner
are for.

### What `LaunchSale` guarantees, and what it does not

`OpenIntelligence/Features/Billing/LaunchSale.swift` advertises nothing unless both hold:

1. `now` is inside `LaunchSale.window`.
2. StoreKit's reported price is strictly below the regular price recorded for Lifetime **in
   that customer's currency**.

Condition 2 means a price change that was never scheduled, never reached a storefront, or has
already reverted produces silence whatever the date says. The percentage comes from the two real
numbers, rounded **down**, so the saving is never overstated, and it is computed per storefront
because Apple rounds each territory to its own price point.

**The limit, stated plainly.** Condition 2 is not "a sale is running", it is "the price is below
a constant compiled into this build". Apple recalculates generated prices when tax and exchange
rates move, so a table recorded today can be wrong in six months and the app would then
advertise a discount nobody scheduled. Run `scripts/verify_sale_prices.py` before every sale.
Separately, `EntitlementStore` caches its products, so `PlanUpgradeSheet` refreshes them on
appear to keep the banner and the checkout price the same number.
`[evidence_level: code_verified, confidence: high, evidence_source: LaunchSale.swift offer(for:storeProduct:now:), PlanUpgradeSheet.swift .task, OpenIntelligenceTests/Features/Billing/LaunchSaleTests.swift]`

### Why only Lifetime is ever discounted

Pro Annual and Pro Monthly are deliberately excluded, for two independent reasons.

- **Pro Annual has already spent its introductory offer.** Its 7-day free trial is an
  introductory offer, and a customer may redeem only one per subscription group, so a discount
  offer would displace the trial rather than add to it.
- **A temporary price change on a subscription creates a price increase later.** When the price
  reverts, everyone who subscribed at the sale price faces an increase at renewal. Apple
  requires consent where a region demands it, where the increase exceeds 50% and about US$50 a
  year, or where the subscriber saw an increase in the last 12 months, and a subscriber who does
  not consent has the subscription expire at the end of the current cycle.

Lifetime is a non-consumable, so it reverts with no consequence for anyone who already bought.
It is also 83% of revenue, so restricting the sale to it costs almost nothing.

### Running a sale

1. `zsh -ic 'python3 scripts/verify_sale_prices.py'` and fix any drift it reports.
2. Schedule the temporary price change on Lifetime Cohort in App Store Connect.
3. Set `LaunchSale.window` to the same dates and ship a build.

Step 1 is not optional; it is what keeps step 3 honest. The full procedure with exact figures is
`Docs/Release/5.2/launch-sale.md`.

### Offer codes, for targeted discounts that leave the list price alone

Offer codes now cover consumables, non-consumables and non-renewing subscriptions, not just
auto-renewable ones, and promo codes for in-app purchases were retired on 2026-03-26. Limits: 10
active offers per app, up to 1,000,000 codes per app per quarter, one-time-use batches of 500 to
25,000, custom-code batches up to 25,000 redemptions, a maximum 6-month expiry, and one
redemption per customer per offer. An offer can be a discounted price rather than free.
`[evidence_level: documented, confidence: exact, evidence_source: https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-in-app-purchases/create-offer-codes-for-in-app-purchases/, fetched 2026-09-09]`

Prefer offer codes over a price change for win-back and targeted outreach: they never touch the
public price and each redemption is attributable.
