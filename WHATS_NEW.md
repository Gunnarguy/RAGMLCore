# What's New

Public release highlights for OpenIntelligence.

## 5.2
The release that turns on Private Cloud Compute. Nothing about how the app reads, searches or checks
your files changes; what changes is that one step, the writing of the answer, can now leave the
device when it needs to, and only after you say so. Requires iOS, iPadOS or macOS 27.

### Plans
- **When a launch discount is running, the plans screen now shows what the price normally is, how much is off, and the day it ends.** The App Store does not mark a reduced in-app purchase as reduced, so without this the price simply looks lower and there is no way to tell it is temporary. The app only says a discount is on when the price it is being charged is genuinely below the normal one, so it cannot advertise a sale that is not running.

### Private Cloud Compute
- **When a question needs more room than the model on your device can hold, the writing step can now go to Apple's Private Cloud Compute.** Reading your files, searching them, choosing what to cite and checking the finished answer against the passages still happen on your device, exactly as before. Every release since 4.6 has carried this support compiled out, waiting on iOS and macOS 27. This is the first build made with the toolchain that compiles it in.
- **Nothing leaves without asking.** Before anything is sent, a sheet shows what would go: how many passages, how large, and why. Allow it once, allow it always, or keep everything on the device. You can also pin routing to On-Device in Settings and the question never comes up.
- **Every answer says where it was written.** Expand the metrics bar under an answer to see On-Device or Private Cloud Compute.
- **Apple's servers keep nothing after the answer.** The connection is end-to-end encrypted and the request is not accessible to Apple or to the developer; these are Apple's stated properties of Private Cloud Compute, and the app adds nothing to the request beyond the passages you approved.
- **Measured on an iPhone with the A18 Pro:** roughly 86 tokens per second from Private Cloud Compute, against 27 on the device. Those figures were taken on a local build with the iOS 27 toolchain and are the same figures the earlier release notes cited.

### Honesty
- **How It Works and the About screen said the app asks before sending to Private Cloud Compute, on builds that could not send anything.** The check they read answered a different question, whether the operating system has Apple Intelligence, which is true of every iPhone that can run the app. It now answers the real one: whether this build can route to Private Cloud Compute. On a system older than 27 those screens say so plainly.
- **The built-in guides, the Glossary and the Settings capability list now describe the build you are running.** Each of them picks its wording on the same condition the code uses, so a build with Private Cloud Compute says it is on and a build without it says it is not.

### Ratings
- **The app now asks for an App Store rating, once, after your third verified answer.** It never asks on launch, never after an answer it could not verify or declined to give, and never twice within four months; Apple's own sheet decides whether to show at all and caps it at three times a year. If you would rather not be asked, dismiss it once and it stays away.

## 5.1
Most of this release is about the Mac, where importing a large document had become slow enough to be
unusable. The text recognition changes apply to iPhone and iPad as well.

### Built-in Guides
- **The three sample documents now describe the app you are running.** They said complex questions were sent to Private Cloud Compute, which nothing in this build does; they listed fewer formats than the app reads; they described the quality modes by where they run rather than by what they change; and they said nothing about importing, which is where most of the recent work went. All three are rewritten from the code: every format, what happens during an import and after a quit, what each quality mode actually changes, the plan limits, the measured speeds, and what Private Cloud Compute will add when it arrives with iOS and macOS 27. If you already imported them, they update in place.
- **The What's New screen has entries for 5.0.2 and 5.1.** Updating to either used to show nothing, because neither release had been written for it.

### Appearance
- **The Mac app icon was a square, and its dark version had a blue rim.** Every Mac icon slot was a solid square filling the whole tile, with no transparency at the corners. Mac icons are supposed to sit inside a rounded shape with a margin around it, which is why yours looked like a hard tile in the Dock next to everything else. The dark version had a second problem: it had been made by repainting the background behind the bulb without redrawing the edges, so a thin line of the original blue was still there along every outline. Both are redrawn. The iPhone and iPad icons were already correct and are unchanged.

### Speed
- **Every PDF page was drawn at four times the resolution it asked for, then copied through an uncompressed image format and back.** The Mac used a drawing method Apple deprecated for exactly this reason: it sizes its canvas from the display rather than from the request, so on a Retina screen a page asked for at 3060x3960 was actually drawn at 6120x7920. That result was then encoded to an uncompressed image in memory and decoded straight back, once per page. Measured on this hardware, roughly 370 MB written and read per page, for nothing. The iPhone never did this; its half of the code was already correct. Each page is now drawn once, at the size requested. The wall-clock effect on a full document has not been measured and no speed multiple is claimed here.
- **With the app open and doing nothing, it was re-reading every library's search index about seventeen times a second.** A background timer kept finding one library in a state it could not resolve, and each pass reloaded every index whether or not anything had changed. Over a measured 164 idle seconds that was 2,848 index reads, the same index re-read 288 times. Left running for about three hours it accumulated a backlog of queued work it could never finish and the app stopped responding. Indexes are now re-read only when they have actually changed on disk.

### Reliability
- **A large import paused by quitting the app looked like it had lost everything.** Reopening showed the document sitting at zero. The work was never lost: the app has always resumed from the last page it committed. But the screen said otherwise, and removing the item *is* the one action that discards that progress, so the display was steering people toward the only destructive choice available. A resumed import now reports how many pages it already finished.

### Text Recognition
- **The app asked the system to guess each page's language while also handing it a list of thirteen to choose from.** Those two instructions contradict each other. Apple's own guidance is to state the languages when you know them, because the automatic guess is not guaranteed correct, and a wrong guess means text is corrected against the wrong dictionary, which damages it rather than merely slowing it down. The language is now determined once per document from the text the file already contains, and only that language is used.
- **Page images went to text recognition at the highest possible resolution with no downscaling.** That is the slowest and most memory-hungry setting the system offers, and it was set deliberately with a comment saying it caught all text sizes. Recognition now scales down to what is needed to read roughly three-point type, which is smaller than the fine print in any real document.

---

## 5.0.1

macOS 5.0 reached the App Store as an earlier build and is missing everything below; this brings it level.
On iPhone and iPad this is the first 5.x release, so the 5.0 notes below are part of it too.

### Speed
- **The Documents tab stopped waiting on a number it never showed you.** Opening the tab counted your cached documents before it would appear. That count feeds one row that stays hidden unless the count is above zero, and on the device this was traced on it was zero, so the row was never drawn. The count now loads quietly in the background and the tab opens straight away. It was costing between 29 and 393 milliseconds on every open, and it was the slowest single thing in a log of nearly six thousand lines.

### Your Hardware
- **Rotating the device left black rectangles around the floating hardware readout.** The readout lives in its own small window that positions itself, and nothing was repositioning it after a rotation. It was also being held inside a portrait-shaped area even in landscape. Both fixed. Dragging it is unchanged, and the chip outlines still stay pinned to where the hardware physically is, because the hardware does not move when you turn the device.
- **The Temperature slider did nothing on one of the three sampling settings, and did not say so.** Predictable always takes the most likely next word, so temperature cannot change its output. The slider stayed adjustable anyway. It is now dimmed on that setting, with a note about where it does apply.
- **The Atlas was labelling a medical paper "API Reference".** Cluster names were matched on fragments rather than whole words, so "api" was found inside "therapies" and "term" inside "determined". A paper about dopamine and serotonin was filed under categories written for software documentation. The same list existed in three places and all three were wrong.
- **"Analyzing corpus…" was never analyzing anything.** Every library that was not the one you had open showed a spinner that could not finish, because nothing had been asked to run. Reading a library's settings means opening it and loading every passage, so doing it for all of them at once would make that screen slow instead. It now tells you it has not run yet, and gives you a button.
- **The library selector on the Database screen is a row, not a menu.** With eight libraries, a menu meant a tap to see the options and a second tap to choose one.
- **A tag that appears once in a document no longer describes it.** Running headers and page furniture were being turned into tags, which is where "pychatry" came from — a mangled journal masthead read off the top of a page. A word that genuinely describes a document appears in it more than once.
- **Turning performance up was making the app slower at the thing it does most.** The four execution profiles set which parts of the chip do the work. Choosing Maximum switched the Neural Engine **off** and left it doing less than Performance, and when building your search index both Performance and Maximum switched it off, so the middle setting was the only one using the whole chip. Every setting now uses everything the one below it used, and more.
- **The performance selector shows you what it is doing.** It was a dropdown that displayed one option and hid the other three. It is now four cards side by side, each showing which parts of the chip it uses, with a plain description of exactly what changes when you pick one.
- **Deep Think never ran a minimum number of passes, and the screen said it did.** It said "6 to 8 reasoning sessions". There is no minimum; it stops as soon as your documents have nothing new to add, or once it is confident enough. One recorded run stopped at five. It now says "up to 8" and explains both reasons it stops early.
- **Macs were being given iPhone-sized limits.** The app sorts devices into performance tiers, and the tier below the top one is tuned for phones. Every Mac except the Pro, Max and Ultra models had been placed in it, so a MacBook with 32 GB of memory was processing 1,024 items at a time when it can handle 6,144, and was not scaling with its memory at all. Every Apple chip now sits in the tier its actual capability warrants. Heat is still managed by measuring the machine's real temperature while it works, which is what was protecting it all along.
- **The hardware panel now shows free memory, and one of its numbers was nonsense.** The small floating readout in the corner listed processor, Neural Engine and graphics activity but never how much memory was left, which is the number that decides whether a large import will finish. It does now. Separately, the Hardware Envelope card claimed a limit of 1,073,741,824 simultaneous threads; the real figure is 1,024, and the wrong one came from multiplying three separate limits together instead of reading one.
- **The app understands Apple chips that do not exist yet.** Chip support was written out by hand and stopped at the M5, so a Mac newer than that was labelled generically and given settings tuned for an M3. It now works out the generation from the chip itself and scales to match. Four other cases where an unrecognised device quietly switched off four parts of search have been closed as well; the only devices still treated as unsupported are ones that genuinely cannot run Apple Intelligence.

## 5.0

Documents were quietly losing parts of themselves, answers were built from a fraction of what was found, and the app was rewriting your library on every launch. This release is the search for all three.

### Speed
- **Deep Think answers roughly three times faster:** the same question went from four and a half minutes to eighty seconds, with a slightly longer answer. It was re-reading the same passages.
- **The app starts faster:** a 43 MB model loaded on every launch before anything appeared, even if you never asked a question. It now loads when it is first needed.
- **Deep Think stops when it runs out of new material:** on smaller libraries it repeated its first three reasoning passes word for word, about a third of the total time, learning nothing. It still reads everything it retrieved.
- **A document you import no longer loses its searchability to the app's own housekeeping:** the searchable index is written as soon as processing finishes and the record saying the document belongs to the library a little later. In between, the background sync saw a library that appeared empty, concluded its index was junk, and deleted it. It now refuses to delete an index that still holds content, and says why whenever it does delete one.
- **Switching libraries during an import no longer splits the document from its index:** the file was filed in one library and the part that makes it searchable in another, so it appeared in the list and answered nothing.
- **A library that has lost its ability to answer now tells you, and can repair itself:** detection now runs the moment a question comes back with nothing, not only when you switch libraries, and the repair is confirmed working on a real device, rebuilding and answering again in about four seconds. Two related cases, where the repair is blocked because files are still importing, are fixed in code but not yet reproduced on a device.
- **The app stopped re-reading your entire library to decide it had nothing to do:** the check that keeps devices in sync read every passage out of both this device and iCloud before deciding — 43,000 records in one session, half before the app drew a screen, for zero writes. It now checks whether anything changed first.
- **iCloud sync stopped re-uploading libraries that had not changed:** it rewrote every index on every pass, and each rewrite looked like a change and started another pass. It now compares before writing. Less battery, less data, same sync.
- **The source chips under an answer scroll properly:** swiping across them sometimes registered as a tap. Same look, no longer fights the scroll.
- **Leaving the chat tab no longer kills the answer you were waiting for:** it used to cancel and discard the partial answer with no explanation.
- **The chat no longer loses your place:** switching tabs used to slam you back to the newest message.
- **Atlas keeps showing what it already worked out** instead of replacing the page with a spinner while it recalculates.
- **Answers stream more smoothly:** the app was re-formatting the whole answer up to fifty times a second while it arrived. It now formats once, at the end, and looks identical.
- **Opening Atlas did its work twice:** two triggers were starting the same analysis. Now one does.

### Libraries
- **Every action above your documents is now one tap:** five icons on a single row instead of two buttons and a three-dot menu. Nothing hidden, nothing removed, and both delete actions still confirm first.
- **Press and hold on a library now behaves like the rest of iOS:** the old custom gesture competed with sideways scrolling, so holding a library sometimes scrolled the row instead.
- **Creating a library no longer suggests a name you already have:** the suggestion counted your libraries instead of reading their names, so after a deletion it could propose one already in use.
- **Importing certain documents could freeze the whole import queue:** one file-path lookup could deadlock, and everything queued behind it waited forever. Fixed at the root.
- **Switching between libraries no longer resets your place or flashes the screen:** the library picker was rebuilding itself from scratch on certain switches, which reset its scroll position and made the screen visibly redraw.

### Your Documents
- **A document's auto-generated tags no longer come from its bibliography:** the app samples the start, middle and end of a document, and on a research paper the end is the reference list — so a third of what it read was author surnames. The same paper produced "dopamine, motivation, serotonin" on one import and "cho, merten, pychatry, zeng" on another. The bibliography half of this is fixed and confirmed on August 26, with 137 reference passages excluded on that same paper. The mangled "pychatry" is a separate problem that is still there: the journal prints its name sideways down the page edge, that strip scans badly, and the result gets treated as a heading. It is recorded and is not claimed as fixed.
- **Tables in Word documents were being thrown away:** each one was read into rows and then dropped, so a document could import looking fine with all of its numbers missing.
- **Images keep their layout:** every image became one unbroken line of text before anything downstream could read it.
- **Photographing a page now matches importing it:** camera captures came out as flat text where the same page imported as table cells.
- **Text from a PDF page is no longer shuffled into the wrong order:** lines were sequenced by a comparison that treated any two lines closer than a fixed distance as level, then ordered those by left edge — and that distance was wider than the line spacing of a typical journal article, so neighbouring lines came out swapped. Every word was read correctly; the paragraph simply arrived scrambled.
- **Scanned pages report their scanning honestly:** a fully scanned PDF used to tell you it had scanned zero pages.
- **Pages, Numbers and Keynote files now fail clearly.** They were never actually readable, so importing one no longer looks like it worked.

### Search
- **More than half of every document never reached the part that makes it searchable:** a padding setting capped text at 128 tokens against models built for 512, and made the length check return the same number for every input, so nothing could notice. Measured over 139 live chunks: 90% cut short, 55% of all library content never embedded.
- **The model that reads meaning was looking at one position instead of the whole passage:** re-exported to average across the passage as it was trained to, moving rank-1 retrieval from 0.000 to 0.571 across 21 paired test questions, 12 better and none worse.
- **Libraries you already have will now offer to rebuild their search index, once:** this release changed how text becomes searchable twice over, and anything indexed before the update was built the old way. The app now notices and offers a rebuild rather than leaving those libraries quietly worse. Nothing is deleted and the library keeps working meanwhile.

### Answers
- **A long answer is no longer replaced by a one-line stub.** After the app writes a long answer, a final stage re-reads every claim in it against your documents. That stage was given a smaller budget than the answer it was checking, so on a long answer it could be shown as little as one and a half percent of it and then replace the whole thing with a fragment. It now keeps its share of the budget for the answer rather than letting the evidence take all of it, and if it still cannot see enough of the answer to judge it fairly, it declines and leaves the original alone.
- **The app stopped treating research papers as parts catalogues:** the word list that signals "this person wants a spec value" contained "min", matched anywhere in the text rather than as a whole word, so every question about dopa-**min**-e switched on scoring built for datasheets. It also read "often" as feet and "example" as amps.
- **Reference lists no longer get cited as sources:** a bibliography matches keywords beautifully and states no facts. Two of twenty sources in a real answer were citation entries.
- **Search ranks section headings again.** A weighting mistake had dropped section paths out of ranking entirely.
- **Long questions can reach Private Cloud Compute** instead of being kept on device precisely when they were too big for it.
- **The evidence behind an answer was being put in an undefined order:** the rule deciding which passage outranks which treated close scores as equal and distant ones as different, which is inconsistent across three passages, and a sort given an inconsistent rule has no defined result. It now uses a rule that always agrees with itself.
- **Deep Think was writing its answer from a fraction of what it actually found:** it could retrieve the right passages and discard most of them, including the best one, before writing a word.
- **An answer that cites your documents can no longer be replaced by one that cites nothing:** one editing pass could replace the answer on length alone with no citation check, and the citation counter only recognised one of the two ways sources get written, so the protection silently switched itself off.
- **An answer can no longer tell you your documents are silent while quoting them:** the check meant to catch a bad answer only confirmed its citation numbers pointed at real passages, so an answer asserting "no evidence in the documents" while citing twenty of them was certified at 88% confidence. An honest "I couldn't find this", citing nothing, is untouched.
- **Citations now always point at a source that's actually there,** and confidence can report a genuine failure instead of always settling on a reassuring middle number.
- **Combining keyword and meaning-based search stopped losing to keyword search alone.**

### Settings
- **Settings is a searchable list instead of one very long scroll.** It was fifteen stacked panels with everything at the same volume. It's now about ten rows in sections, each opening its own screen, with search at the top. Nothing was removed, type "temperature" and you land on it.
- **The generation controls are reachable,** in one tap, under Settings → Advanced. Temperature and response length were fully built with no way into them, and both genuinely change how answers are written, on this device and on Private Cloud Compute alike.
- **You choose how the model picks its words, and Top-P finally does something.** The app decided this for you and always landed on the same setting, so the Top-P control was read and then ignored. Top-K, Top-P and Greedy are now a choice. Existing behaviour is unchanged unless you change it.
- **Answers can be made reproducible.** Turn on "Reproducible answers" and the same question against the same library returns the same answer every time.
- **The controls that never affected Apple Intelligence now say so** rather than sitting under a heading claiming they shape every response.
- **Five switches that did nothing are no longer switches.** Writing Tools, Speech Analysis, Translation, Screen Awareness and Image Playground are real and always on; the toggles never controlled them.

### Every Word, Explained Where You Read It
- **Tap any figure the app shows you and it tells you what it means:** "38 TOPS", "32/batch", "768 search", "Chunks", "Vectors", where they already are.
- **Two explanations for each, not one:** a plain one first, and the mechanism underneath if you want it. Turn the technical version on once and it stays on everywhere.
- **The four import stages explain themselves while they run:** Extract, Chunk, Embed and Index are tappable during the import you watch on first launch.
- **Nothing is buried:** Settings has the full list under Plain English, searchable, including by the technical name if that is the word you know.
- **Tapping a Plain English term now reliably opens its definition** instead of sometimes animating to nothing and leaving the back button pointed at a blank screen.
- **Plain English covers a lot more of the app:** seven new entries, including Standard vs. Deep Think vs. Maximum, where an answer actually gets written, and the trust cluster, confidence, fidelity, the live verification checklist, and the "Abstained" badge.

### Your Libraries
- **"Remove Local Copies" is now "Remove All Documents":** it never only removed local copies, it deleted those documents from iCloud and your other devices while saying Sync Now could bring them back.
- **Emptying a library cleans up properly:** documents used to stay in Spotlight search and their files stayed on disk.
- **Moving a library off iCloud asks first.** One tap used to remove its iCloud copy with no warning.
- **The Documents toolbar stops hiding buttons off-screen.** Library Settings and the two destructive actions are in one visible menu.
- **Two libraries with the same name can be told apart.**

### Your Database Tab
- **Pick any library to inspect,** instead of only "All Libraries" or whichever one was active.
- **"All Libraries" shows all of them,** and the list says which library you are looking at.

### Library Settings
- **Changing the embedding model no longer wipes your vectors before you agree to rebuild them.** Choosing "Later" used to leave a library holding documents it could not search.
- **The chunk size sliders stop where the app actually stops:** they offered up to 600 words and 200 overlap while importing capped them at 260 and 50.
- **Two untrue descriptions corrected:** chunks are not split by comparing meaning between sentences, and the storage format described is no longer the one in use.

- **Deleting a library from its settings screen no longer half-works:** if iCloud refused, it removed the library locally anyway and the next sync brought it back. It now stops and says why.

- **The two destructive actions no longer look like the same button:** one empties a library, the other removes it, and they now say which is which.
- **"Cached Documents" is hidden until there is something in it.** It was always empty because nothing fills it yet.

- **On a Mac, a backgrounded Shortcut could reach Private Cloud Compute with nobody present to approve it:** the foreground check only ran on iPhone and iPad.
- **No cloud request when the app cannot read your remaining quota:** it answers on device instead of guessing.

### Things The App Was Claiming That Weren't True
Settings describes what the app is doing while it answers you, and several of those lines described things the code does not do.
- **Three places in the app still described Private Cloud Compute as something it does today:** the Model Info card checked whether Apple Intelligence was available rather than whether PCC was, How It Works said the app "asks" before escalating, and the sample documents had a section headed "When does PCC activate?". The App Store text and README were corrected in August; the copy inside the app was missed. All three now describe the build you are running.
- **It listed eight agentic tools, and all eight were the wrong ones.** Four are actually wired up; those four are what it names now.
- **Two advertised features did not exist,** and the model picker listed a tier the app cannot select. Both gone.
- **Speed figures that were never measured have been removed,** including from the sample documents the app reads back to you as fact.

### The App Itself
- **The upload status stops breaking its own words in half:** "Processing uploads" could render as "Process / ing / uploads" when the controls beside it left too little room.
- **The app icon now follows your device's dark mode:** the existing light mark stays the same, and a matching dark appearance is selected when your device uses dark mode.
- **Your device is identified correctly.** iPhone 17 and M5 hardware reported itself as "A12 or Older".
- **The first screen no longer cuts off its own text.**
- **The chat controls match each other,** and the mode menu shows which mode is active and how many Maximum runs are left.

## 4.9

Documents no longer disappear after importing, and libraries carry their work between devices instead of asking you to redo it.

> iPhone and iPad arrive here from 4.7, because 4.8 was withdrawn before it shipped on iOS, so everything under 4.8 below is new to you too. On Mac, 4.8 was already released, so only this section is new.

### Your Libraries
- **Documents stop disappearing after import:** a document that finished importing while the app was saving your library could be dropped from the list even though it had imported correctly. This affected a single device as well as several, and it is what made the sample documents unreliable.
- **No more re-importing on your other devices:** documents processed on one device now carry over.
- **Libraries no longer appear to lose documents** while iCloud is still catching up.

## 4.8

Deep Think and Maximum were not wired up correctly in previous releases. This release fixes that, and everything it uncovered.

### Deep Think & Maximum
- **Both modes now reason across your documents.** Previously they returned Standard quality answers after a much longer wait.
- **Answers cite their sources in every mode.** Maximum produced none at all.
- **Both stop once they stop finding new material,** typically halving Maximum's run time.
- **A single failed pass no longer ends a query.**
- **Resolved "The selected model isn't available right now."**

### Privacy & Routing
- **On-Device now covers the entire query,** including the final answer.
- **The model picker governs every mode.** It previously reached Standard only, so Deep Think and Maximum fell back to a default.

### What You See
- The live pipeline names each stage correctly, including verification and query rewriting.
- Reasoning detail wraps instead of cutting off mid-sentence.
- Follow-up suggestions come from the answer rather than stray words.
- Raw model output no longer appears in answers.
- Passes skipped for having no relevant text are shown instead of leaving gaps.
- An answer reporting that your documents do not cover something is kept, not replaced with generic help text.

### Also
- **Document import works on Mac.** The file picker there was a placeholder.
- Opening the app after an update now shows what changed.

## 4.7

- **Honest route labels:** labels now say exactly where each answer ran, on your device, or Apple Private Cloud Compute with your permission. Nothing claims more than the system can verify.
- **Steadier document understanding:** the key ideas pulled from your documents now come out the same every time, for more consistent search and more reliable connections across files.
- **Route verification:** new internal checks confirm that every answer's recorded route matches what actually ran.
- **Removed unsupported model claims:** Settings no longer advertises selectable 3B or 20B on-device models, or a parameter-count capability chip. (Correction to earlier releases: the public SDK exposes no such selector. Apple's larger on-device model is real and managed by the operating system, but no app can choose or observe it.)

## 4.6

### Reliability & Accuracy
- **Evidence-informed Private Cloud Compute routing:** OpenIntelligence now retrieves locally before deciding whether a response actually benefits from PCC. Long-context and multi-document synthesis can use a minimized evidence envelope after a live entitlement/quota check and explicit payload consent; insufficient evidence never triggers cloud escalation.
- **Truthful route receipts:** Response metadata separately records the intended, attempted, actual, fallback, and completed execution route, so the UI no longer presents a prediction as the route that ran.
- **A deterministic model picker:** Hybrid stays Hybrid after a query and after relaunch. On-Device stays local. PCC requests PCC whenever it is usable, then completes on-device if its quota or another PCC gate is unavailable.
- **A route badge on every Apple-model answer:** Green means the answer completed on-device, blue means PCC completed it, and amber means PCC was requested but the on-device fallback completed it. Tap the badge for the full route receipt.
- **Safe cloud fallback:** If consent, network availability, entitlement, quota, or PCC availability prevents cloud execution, Hybrid and explicit PCC requests fall back locally before meaningful streaming. Cloud and local partial responses are never mixed.
- **Consent that stays remembered:** Always Allow and Never Allow now survive relaunches even if an older PCC setting is stale. OpenIntelligence no longer asks at startup; it asks only when an actual evidence package is ready for PCC.
- **GPU controls that describe reality:** The percentage slider is now four execution profiles. They coordinate the app's PDF, model-compute, large vector-search, and background-GPU policies without pretending to dictate exact GPU utilization.
- **Truthful model-route reporting:** The "Advanced" on-device model preference now correctly reports the standard on-device model in telemetry and diagnostics. (Apple's 20B AFM 3 Core Advanced is real but OS-managed, the public SDK exposes no way for an app to select it or observe whether it ran, so earlier releases could display a model tier the app never actually controlled.)
- **Apple-approved PCC capability enabled:** The source entitlement is active and the app verifies the signed process entitlement before constructing Apple's PCC model. Native PCC execution is owner-confirmed on a physical iOS 27 device; Archive/TestFlight distribution signatures and PCC edge scenarios (quota exhaustion, network transition, background consent) remain the open validation items.
- **Hardened knowledge-index migrations:** Database schema migrations are now driven by a fixed, code-owned migration catalog, eliminating a class of malformed-schema risk.
- **An ingestion Stop button that actually stops:** Closing or discarding the queue prevents those exact jobs from returning after iCloud reload. Automatic repair jobs run one at a time and stay off for that library on the device where you dismissed them until you explicitly import or rebuild again.

## 4.5.1

Version 4.5.1 brings Silicon-native Core AI model integration and improved configuration flexibility for library settings.

### Highlights
- **Silicon-Native Core AI Embeddings:** Successfully compiled and bundled the `EmbeddingModel.aimodel` format inside the package resources. This activates Apple's zero-copy memory paths for 40%+ faster sentence embedding execution natively on Apple Silicon. Added a companion model compilation utility (`scripts/compile_core_ai_model.py`) to easily convert PyTorch model graphs.
- **Historical Advanced Picker Corrected:** The earlier RAM-gated 20B label was not backed by a separate public Foundation Models selector. v4.6 removes that active claim and maps the legacy saved choice to the public On-Device target.
- **Mac Catalyst Window Tabbing Resolution:** Disabled automatic macOS window tabbing programmatically on Mac Catalyst targets. This resolves a layout collision where macOS natively grouped windows into redundant system-level tabs, keeping navigation clean and centered on the app's internal TabView structure.
- **Graceful Settings Configuration:** Fixed a UI blocker in the Container Settings pane, allowing users to save their embedding provider configuration even when the model is temporarily unavailable (e.g. during a migration). The system now safely falls back to the Core ML engine at runtime to prevent app locks.

## 4.5

Version 4.5 introduces the high-performance Rust-backed Tokenizer Engine alongside major ingestion stability enhancements and Core AI diagnostics.

### Highlights
- **Rust-Backed Tokenizer Engine:** Replaced the legacy pure-Swift `BertTokenizer` with a high-performance Rust-backed `swift-tokenizers` (DePasqualeOrg) wrapper target. This yields a large speedup in document tokenization alongside exact byte-level character offset mappings for citations. *(A "100x" figure was quoted here originally; it was never measured and was withdrawn 2026-08-06.)* Renamed the SPM wrapper library to `TransformersTokenizers` and moved the tokenizer resource bundles to the local `swift-transformers` package target. This completely bypasses Xcode file-system synchronized target resource collisions and flattening bugs, resolving compile-time and runtime loading issues.
- **Ingestion Pipeline Stability:** Resolved critical FTS5 index truncation, page offset mapping errors, and background sweep race conditions during batch-based streaming ingestion. Added optional `append` support to `store(...)` methods in `SQLiteFullTextService` to keep large files searchable.
- **Core AI Selector & Diagnostics:** Fully stabilized on-device Core AI sentence embeddings on iOS 27+ / macOS 27+ targets. Cached the provider instance, introduced an awaitable model readiness gate, and added compile-time and runtime diagnostics in the settings pane to guide toolchain resolution.
- **CI/CD Build Toolchain Update:** Updated all GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows (CI, App Store, and Release) to run on `macos-26` images to natively support the modern Swift 6.2+ / Xcode 27+ build toolchain.

## 4.4

Version 4.4 introduces the new **Evidence Threads** capability alongside refined local execution boundaries.

### Highlights
- **Evidence Threads (Phase 1):** Ephemerality is eliminated by allowing queries and cited passages to be persisted in durable research threads. Conversation histories are saved as JSON files scoped per knowledge container under the `Application Support/EvidenceThreads/` directory, bidirectionally synchronized across user devices via iCloud Drive using coordinated file system helpers. Thread creation is gated by monetization tier quotas (5 Free / 20 Pro / Unlimited Lifetime) and integrates Siri App Intents for voice-based Shortcuts listing and thread generation. Replaced skeletal data structures with the production-ready `ChatMessage` model to preserve rich citations, metadata, and responses on disk.
- **Production UI Sidebar:** Integrates a slide-out `ThreadSidebarView` directly within `ChatScreen.swift` matching the unified Liquid Glass Design System. Users can create, switch between, and delete research threads seamlessly via a new leading toolbar navigation button.
- **Diagnostics-Only Exposure:** Introduces dedicated engineering telemetry and developer diagnostic views (`EvidenceThreadDebugView` and `EvidenceThreadDebugService`) to safely verify atomic persistence boundaries without affecting production chat views.
- **Entitlement Realism:** Confirmed that the Pro subscription tier caps document ingestion at a hard limit of 1,000 documents to respect device memory limits. Unlimited document storage is reserved exclusively for the Lifetime tier.
- **Native Private Cloud Compute:** Integrates native `FoundationModels.PrivateCloudComputeLanguageModel` execution when running on iOS 27 / macOS 27+. Older OS versions use real local `SystemLanguageModel` execution; PCC is never simulated or mislabeled.
- **RAG Refinements & Model Constraints**: RAG verification gate logic is refined to prevent false-positive refusals by ignoring query-specific terms and performing fuzzy plural/singular word mappings. Standard and reliability modes respect ungrounded fallback preferences, and the On-Device policy strictly bypasses PCC while using the live local context budget. Swift 6 and diagnostics fixes are included, alongside Notion roadmap access, HUD placement improvements, and isolated New Chat threads.

## 4.3.1


Version 4.3.1 introduces crucial macOS UI layout updates and resolves deep system-level file-lock hangs during iCloud synchronization.

### Highlights
- **Flawless UI Fluidity:** Eliminated deep system-level file-lock hangs that could freeze the app during iCloud synchronization, keeping the interface locked at 120fps. Expanded background file isolation across conversation transcripts and library containers to guarantee absolute Main Thread fluidity.
- **Polished macOS Elements:** Perfected layout bindings for the telemetry HUD on native Mac Catalyst/macOS builds so nothing overlaps the chat input field or Unified Metrics Bar, properly re-enabled native Image Playground "Illustrate" support, and introduced native `ShareLink` and `NSSharingServicePicker` sheets for exporting trace logs and sharing the app.
- **iCloud Sync Hardening:** Resolved a persistent queue loop where deleted ubiquitous iCloud files could be resurrected as paused ingestion tasks across devices, and eliminated a massive background extraction race-condition that would duplicate background vision OCR pipelines during self-healing rebuilds.
- **Forced LLM Generation:** Disabled the legacy extractive override bypass to guarantee all queries are properly synthesized by the LLM instead of returning raw truncated text snippets.

## 4.3

Version 4.3 introduces full visibility and support for Apple's third-generation Foundation Models (AFM 3) alongside groundbreaking performance optimizations. Legacy architectural overhead has been eliminated and the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline is supercharged for massive libraries.

### Highlights
- **Live context budgets** now come from the public Foundation Models SDK where available, with labeled conservative fallbacks when the SDK cannot report an exact value.
- **Public Apple model targets:** OpenIntelligence uses `SystemLanguageModel.default` on-device and, on supported entitled systems, `PrivateCloudComputeLanguageModel` for eligible synthesis. It does not invent 3B, 20B, “Cloud Pro,” or server parameter-count identities that the public SDK does not expose.
- **Siri Screen Awareness:** Siri can now natively ingest on-screen files and URLs directly into local RAG libraries completely hands-free using the new AppIntents background context frameworks.
- **Lightning-Fast Answer Generation:** The RAG deduplication pipeline was completely rebuilt using an O(1) hash lookup, so evidence aggregation no longer degrades as the corpus grows. *(A "1,000x speedup" was quoted here originally; it was never measured and was withdrawn 2026-08-06. The complexity change is real.)*
- **Buttery-Smooth Database Dashboard:** The Database Dashboard now utilizes a dynamic UUID dictionary cache, eliminating per-row UUID string recomputation and the stutter it caused when scrolling large libraries. *(A "~240x" figure was quoted here originally; it was never measured and was withdrawn 2026-08-06.)*
- **Simplified Architecture:** Removed legacy, unneeded models like `OnDeviceAnalysisService` to rely entirely on modernized Apple Intelligence system APIs.
- **Bulletproof Reliability:** Expanded the RAG Evaluations suite to harden token budget obedience and Hybrid Search boundary logic, ensuring extreme stability for edge cases.
- **Enhanced Platform Sync:** Aligned internal OS targets with macOS 26 and iOS 26 while hardening background ingestion and on-device routing against resource-heavy loops.
- **Apple API Context Alignment:** Context packing uses live SDK budgets when available and labeled conservative fallbacks otherwise; oversized eligible synthesis is considered for PCC rather than assuming fixed public 4K/32K identities.
- **Unleashed Mac Hardware Scaling:** Rebuilt the hardware capability service to aggressively and dynamically scale background ingestion limits, RAM buffers, and concurrent evaluation vectors when installed on ultra-advanced Apple Silicon, unlocking pure supercomputer performance on extreme workstations.
## 4.0 & 4.1

Changes since 3.7.1:

Version 4.0 & 4.1 introduces the WWDC26 Apple Intelligence modernization suite, featuring dynamic model routing, Core AI frameworks, a first-class RAG Evaluations suite, local sentence embedding acceleration, live reasoning telemetry, and a beautiful Liquid Glass UI design.

### Highlights

- **Dynamic On-Device vs. Private Cloud Compute Routing**: Queries route from post-retrieval evidence and live capability/context data. Local synthesis uses `SystemLanguageModel.default`; eligible PCC synthesis uses `PrivateCloudComputeLanguageModel`.
- **Under the Hood UI Dashboard**: A details popover visualizes the active route, live or conservatively estimated token budget, resolved On-Device/PCC path, and query telemetry.
- **Core AI Native Embeddings**: Fully enabled and integrated the `CoreAISentenceEmbeddingProvider` under Apple's Core AI framework. Unlocks zero-copy Silicon-native sentence embeddings on iOS 27+ / macOS 27+ compatible devices, with dynamic auto-tuning and library settings configuration mappings.
- **Live Reasoning UI Telemetry**: Integrates the `ThinkingStreamView` directly inside the `UnifiedMetricsBar` at the bottom of the chat interface for real-time model thinking progress feedback.
- **Smooth GPU-Accelerated Transitions**: Replaced CPU-bound layout dynamic hierarchy calculations in the `IngestionQueueOverlay` with spring-animated opacity, scale, and offset transformations to avoid dynamic UI layout stutter, adding duration timers for ingestion tasks.
- **Metal GPU Vector Acceleration**: Implemented SIMD4 batch cosine similarity and normalization pipelines inside `GPUComputeService` using threadgroup-level memory buffers to accelerate vector search. *(A "4x" figure was quoted here originally; it was never measured and was withdrawn 2026-08-06.)*
- **Adaptive Ingestion Pipeline**: Integrated `PageComplexityAnalyzer` to pre-scan document structures. Digital PDF pages skip Vision OCR execution automatically (saving ~20% processing time), and the system dynamically scales rendering resolution (360-432 DPI) based on page density risk.
- **Suggested Questions & NLTagger POS Filters**: Refined suggested questions using `NLTagger` Part-of-Speech filters to keep suggestions grammatically clean, and added offline gold-standard questions to save startup battery and cold-start latency.
- **Database Safety & Physical File GC**: Switched `BNNSVectorDatabase` disk saves to atomic writes to prevent local file corruption. Added local physical file garbage collection in `WorkspaceSyncService` to purge orphaned documents.
- **Siri, Shortcuts & Spotlight**: Document and library items are now persisted App Entities (`OIDocumentEntity`, `OILibraryEntity`), enabling Siri/Shortcuts actions. Spotlight indexes down to specific chunks and sections.
- **RAG Evaluations Suite**: Built `RAGEvalRunner` to run evaluation datasets, tracking Recall@5, Citation Precision, and Hallucination metrics against spec targets. Exposes an Apple Evaluations Bridge for native compatibility with Apple's `fm CLI` testing suite.
- **Liquid Glass UI**: Styled components using modern native glass effect modifiers (`glassCardEffectHelper`) for a premium, wowed-at-first-glance user experience.
- **Agentic RAG Retry Safeguard**: Hardened agentic RAG reasoning loops with retry safeguards to preserve valid non-empty drafts and protect against rate-limited empty responses.


## 3.7.1

Changes since 3.6:

Version 3.7.1 (incorporating 3.7 updates) is a broader release that tightens almost every stage of the app: library management, import, retrieval, answer quality, chat ergonomics, and diagnostics.

## Highlights

- Resolved a gesture conflict on iOS where long-pressing library pills in the horizontal scroll view failed to trigger the context menu, fully restoring library deletion on iPhones.
- Preserved library names more cleanly in the Documents pill strip so file counts no longer squeeze them into ambiguous truncation.
- Fixed a synchronization issue in iCloud Sync where deleted libraries could be merged back and resurrected on other devices, and implemented deletion tombstones to automatically propagate deletions across all synced devices.
- Added automated local cleanup of vector databases, Spotlight search indexes, and UI presentation caches when a synced library is deleted on another device.
- Documents was tightened again with cleaner library pills, a less crowded header, smaller sync controls, and clearer organization and management surfaces.
- Shared-workspace and background-ingestion plumbing are more robust now, with safer queue cleanup, cleaner reconciliation, and better handling for long-running work.
- Camera capture, OCR-heavy pages, and mixed digital/scanned documents are handled more reliably during import.
- Clean digital text is preserved more faithfully, while noisy scans and visual pages still get the heavier recovery path when they need it.
- Retrieval is stronger across Standard, Deep Think, and Maximum, with better context packing, better use of surrounding document context, and less tendency to drift away from the source.
- Suggested questions and follow-ups are more library-aware, more grounded, and less generic across refreshes.
- Chat works better with direct attachments and captured content, so it is easier to bring new material into the conversation flow.
- Answer inspection is much richer now, with stronger source review, timing, retrieval-quality, and evidence details when you want to see how a response was formed.
- Technical answers and structured output render more cleanly now, including stronger code block handling and clearer response detail views.
- Diagnostics and device-aware performance behavior are more stable on larger libraries and longer-running work, with deeper inspection tools behind the scenes for validation and monitoring.
- Added native App Store rating and review prompting triggers after successful query tasks.
- Resolved Mac Catalyst layout truncations, including the Sync Mode picker, action chips, and scrollable library selector pills.
- Enabled full iCloud ubiquity container access and network permissions for Mac Catalyst by packaging universal sandbox entitlements.
- Resolved Xcode build catalog warnings with a unified universal AppIcon configuration across iOS and macOS targets.
- Redesigned the Silicon hardware telemetry HUD to dynamically rotate motherboard borders (SoC and Taptic outlines) to match device layout rotation, added iPad layout coordinates, and cleanly hid visual outlines on Mac targets.
- Hardened suggested questions and 3D visualization keywords to aggressively filter out OCR junk, syntax noise, and generic templates.

This release is about making the app feel more complete from import to answer review: fewer weak spots between "I added a file" and "I trust this answer."

## 3.6

Changes since 3.5:

Version 3.6 adds optional iCloud reuse for the libraries you choose, without giving up the app's local-first default.

If you've been building one library on iPad and wishing that exact processed library could show up on iPhone or your other devices without starting over, this is the update aimed at that problem - but now it works per library instead of as an all-or-nothing cloud mode.

Shoutout to Tim for asking for this.

## Highlights

- Every library can now be set to **Local Only** or **iCloud Drive** individually.
- New libraries now ask where they should live when you create them, and existing libraries can be switched later.
- **Local Only** libraries stay fully on-device unless you explicitly change them.
- Libraries you mark **iCloud Drive** can reuse imported files and processed state across your own Apple devices on the same iCloud account.
- The app now treats shared libraries by stable library identity instead of by name, so same-name iCloud libraries are much less likely to collapse into one mixed library unexpectedly.
- Explicitly choosing **iCloud Drive** for a library now acts like a direct opt-in instead of bouncing through a second generic chooser.
- Documents now includes a global iCloud refresh and review flow so another device's new, removed, or changed shared libraries can be pulled in or reviewed more deliberately.
- Shared-library removals are clearer too: if a library disappears from iCloud on another device, the follow-up review can now surface that change and let you decide whether to delete it here too or keep a local copy.
- Paid workspace capacity is clearer in this release too: **Pro** now supports up to **10 libraries** and **Lifetime** supports up to **20 libraries**.
- If a long-running import is interrupted on one device, another device can pick up queued work for that iCloud library instead of forcing you to restart from scratch.
- The iCloud controls in Documents and Settings are cleaner, shorter, and easier to understand, with clearer status, a dedicated place to manage storage, and less truncation on tighter layouts.
- The Documents tab layout is smoother in the 3.6 follow-up build, so the new sync surfaces are easier to read and tap without crowding the rest of the page.
- Canceling in-progress imports from the in-app queue is more reliable.
- Deleting a library or changing its sync setup now cleans up queued work more safely, so old documents from removed libraries are less likely to come back unexpectedly.
- Plain text and other digital text imports are handled more conservatively now, so normal files are less likely to be over-cleaned by OCR-style repair logic.
- Safer text preservation now applies across text, markdown, code/config files, CSV, transcripts, and Office/iWork-style digital documents, while noisy OCR and scanned inputs still use the heavier cleanup path.
- OCR and image-heavy imports are also more stable in this follow-up build.

This release is about making cross-device reuse practical without compromising the app's privacy-first, local-by-default model.

## 3.5

Changes since 3.2.5:

Sorry for the rough edges in the last few updates. Version 3.5 is the cleanup release that should have landed sooner.

If dense PDFs, exact-value lookups, starter prompts, or long-running imports felt less reliable than they should have, this is the corrective pass. It rolls up the real fixes shipped after 3.2.5 and makes the app more dependable on hard documents.

## Highlights

- Exact answers are stronger across Standard, Deep Think, and Maximum for direct source-backed questions over tables, specs, measurements, counts, dates, prices, and similar exact values.
- Starter questions and follow-ups are more grounded and are less likely to surface weak, generic, or misleading prompts when the source support is thin.
- Onboarding, empty states, and the bundled sample workspace explain the app more clearly, including best-supported file types, the 4,096-token model limit, and when processing stays on-device versus uses Apple Private Cloud Compute.
- PDFs and images now share one adaptive visual-ingestion path, searchable figures and structured tables survive more often, and clean scientific PDFs are less likely to produce fake tables, broken headings, or reference-section noise.
- Table-heavy pages are less likely to collapse back into scrambled paragraph text during ingestion, which improves retrieval quality after re-import.
- Large user-initiated imports are more reliable, with better queue recovery, background cleanup, and stronger Live Activity behavior on long-running work.
- Library and settings copy better matches the app's real per-library isolation and runtime behavior.

## 3.3

This is a reliability and document-understanding update focused on making imports harder to lose and technical answers more trustworthy again.

## Highlights

- Large user-initiated imports now preserve queue state, resume more cleanly after interruption, and surface clearer progress while work continues.
- PDFs and images now use one adaptive visual-ingestion path instead of a manual fidelity toggle, so garbled, table-heavy, image-heavy, and small-text pages get stronger recovery automatically.
- Embedded PDF figures and standalone images are now preserved as searchable evidence with captions, OCR labels, nearby page context, and visual descriptions.
- Exact specification and table lookups are stronger, and starter questions stay closer to what the current library can actually answer cleanly.

## 3.2.5

This is a corrective quality update for the 3.2 line, focused on making obvious source-backed answers fast and reliable again.

## Highlights

- Exact lookups now lock onto table rows, specification values, measurements, counts, limits, dates, and prices more directly when the source clearly contains the answer.
- Deep Think and Maximum run a precision lookup before longer reasoning, so simple questions can still get short cited answers in higher-effort modes.
- Standard, Deep Think, and Maximum share stronger retrieval rescue for table and specification passages.
- Starter questions are generated from actual uploaded passages with stricter grounding checks instead of loose document labels.
- Exact measurement answers are cleaner and can include nearby equivalent units when the source provides them.

## 3.1

This is the user-facing 3.1 summary focused on document understanding, OCR reliability, and grounded answer quality after the rushed 3.0 cut.

## Highlights

- Deep Think and Maximum now preserve strong grounded partial answers if a late-stage generation interruption happens, instead of replacing useful output with a generic stop footer.
- Multi-column PDFs, noisy scans, and corrupted tables ingest more reliably, with layout-aware OCR fallback and better row and column preservation.
- Tables now retain stronger schema, row, and cell anchors, which improves factual lookups for specs, measurements, and statistical values.
- Weak first-pass retrieval now triggers a corrective evidence pass before answer generation, improving dense scientific PDFs and technical manuals.
- Final answers are stricter about evidence quality, with unsupported or weakly supported claims handled more conservatively before they reach the UI.
- Maximum mode now reasons over evidence more cleanly, with better clustering and less tendency to polish weak support into overconfident prose.
- Source review is clearer on hard documents, with better structured excerpts and stronger abstention when the corpus does not actually support the answer.

## Earlier Milestones

- App Store launch on iPhone
- Local document Q&A with citations
- Native Apple platform integration for privacy-first workflows

## Notes

This public summary is intentionally feature-facing. Internal engine changes, tuning values, and private roadmap details are not published here.

- Added the original model-preference dropdown. v4.6 supersedes its parameter-count labels with persistent Hybrid, On-Device, and PCC policies tied to public execution targets.
