"""Re-read the Lifetime regular prices from App Store Connect and report drift.

    zsh -ic 'python3 scripts/verify_sale_prices.py'

WHY THIS EXISTS

`LaunchSale.regularLifetimePrices` is a table of pre-sale prices compiled into the app. The
paywall shows a struck-through "was" figure from it, so a stale entry is a false claim about
money. Two things can make it stale:

  1. Apple recalculates its generated per-territory prices when tax rates or exchange rates
     move. Nothing in the repo notices.
  2. A permanent price change that nobody mirrored back into the Swift table.

It also re-checks the assumption that makes keying by currency safe at all: that every
territory sharing a currency carries the same price. That held across all 177 generated
territories on 2026-09-09, but it is a property of this price schedule, not a promise from
Apple.

Run this before scheduling any sale. Exit code 0 means the table matches App Store Connect.

Reads APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID, _ISSUER_ID and _API_KEY_PATH from the environment, which
~/.zshrc exports, so run it through `zsh -ic`. See Docs/ai/RUNBOOK.md.
