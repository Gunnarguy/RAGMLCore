Every mode needs App Store Connect credentials, including the ones that write nothing, because
resolving a price point is a read against Apple. `~/.zshrc` exports them and a non-interactive
shell does not, so run it through `zsh -ic`.

WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT THE WEB UI

The sale has two halves that must agree: the price in App Store Connect, and `LaunchSale.window`
compiled into the app. This takes one pair of dates and writes both, so they cannot be mistyped
apart. It does not remove every way they can diverge: `--write-window` edits a source file, and
a source file only reaches customers when it is built and shipped.

WHAT THE API REQUIRES, AND WHY THIS IS NOT A ONE-LINE POST

A price schedule is replaced wholesale. There is no "add a price change" call: POSTing to
/v1/inAppPurchasePriceSchedules submits the **entire** schedule, and at least one price in it
must carry `startDate: null`, which is the standing price. So a temporary sale is two rows:

    row 1   the regular price, startDate null, endDate null   <- must be included
    row 2   the sale price, startDate and endDate set         <- reverts to row 1 on expiry

[evidence_level: inferred, confidence: high, evidence_source:
https://github.com/dfabulich/node-app-store-connect-api README, "you must set the entire price
schedule at once; you can't append an upcoming price change to start after the current price. And,
therefore, at least one of the prices that you set must have startDate: null", fetched 2026-09-09;
request shape from https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/732527, same date. Apple's own
reference documents the field names but not this behaviour, and I have not tested omission against
a live schedule, so the consequence of leaving row 1 out is inferred rather than measured. The
design does not depend on which way it resolves: row 1 is always sent.]

Because the schedule is replaced rather than amended, this reads the live schedule first and
refuses to write if what it finds is not what it expects, snapshots it before every write, and
re-reads afterwards to check the standing price survived.
