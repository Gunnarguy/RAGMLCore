//  `LaunchSale.percentOff` is the only arithmetic in this app that turns into a public claim
//  about money, so it is pinned here rather than trusted.
//
//  The `Product`-taking entry point cannot be reached from a unit test, because StoreKit
//  products cannot be constructed outside a StoreKitTest session. The percentage maths and the
//  refusals are split out precisely so they can be tested without one.
