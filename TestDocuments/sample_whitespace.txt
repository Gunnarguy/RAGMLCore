This document          contains          excessive         whitespace         to test       parsing      robustness.


Multiple             blank              lines             should             be             handled             correctly.



	Tabs	and	other	whitespace	characters	need	proper	handling.


Trailing spaces at the end of lines          
Should not break the parser                    
Or cause any issues                        


Mixed    whitespace  	 types 	   	including   	spaces, 	 tabs,  	and  	various  	combinations.





Document content should still be extractable and usable despite formatting issues.


                                    End of whitespace test.
